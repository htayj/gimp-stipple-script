A very simple GIMP script to convert shading to stipples

* limitations
I wrote this several years ago using gimp's script-fu scheme plugin system. It has a number of limitations:
- lack of blending between shades
- requires posterization of the image
- requires the image to be in grayscale color mode
- very slow and eats memory

it is probably best not to use this script, checkout out [[https://www.gimp-forum.net/Thread-ofn-manual-stipple][ofn manual stipple]] instead.
